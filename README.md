# Data Wrangling OpenStreetMap
Udacity Course - Data Wrangling OpenStreetMap Data

## Purpose
This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. A xml osm file was downloaded for a selected area from OpenStreetMap. This report details the data auditing and cleaning performed on the raw dataset. After the data is cleaned, it is transformed and stored in a SQL database with a set [schema](https://github.com/ian-whitestone/datawranglingopenstreetmap/blob/master/toronto_db_schema.sql). With the stored dataset, the data and the chosen area are further explored.
