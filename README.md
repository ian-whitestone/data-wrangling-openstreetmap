# Data Wrangling OpenStreetMap
Udacity Course - Data Wrangling OpenStreetMap Data

## Purpose
This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. A xml osm file was downloaded for a selected area from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This report details the data auditing and cleaning performed on the raw dataset. After the data is cleaned, it is transformed and stored in a SQL database with a set [schema](https://github.com/ian-whitestone/datawranglingopenstreetmap/blob/master/toronto_db_schema.sql). With the stored dataset, the data and the chosen area are further explored.

## Map Area

For this project I selected a section of downtown [Toronto, Ontario, Canada](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/43.6561/-79.3903).
